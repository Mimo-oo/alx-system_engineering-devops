Specific
In addition to completing the project tasks and submitting the required screenshots to GitHub, you are also required to demonstrate the use of the SFTP (Secure File Transfer Protocol) command-line tool to move your local screenshots to the sandbox environment.


Steps:
1. I completed all the task (1 - 27).
2. I made screenshot after every 7 projects.
3. When i was done with the 27th task, i renamed each task according the names we are supposed to use.
4. I opened the sandbox and i used my windows powershell to connect to the server  via SFTP.
5. i navigated to the directory where the screenshots where saved using (lcd and lls).
6. lcd was used to navigate the current directory while lls was used to list files in the curren directory.
5. I used the command PUT *.jpg to copy the files from the working directory to the the remote environment.*
7. Then i quit the powershell and i switched to webterm using the sandbox.
8. i navigated to the folder and i used the command cp name_of_file.png name_of_file.jpg to rename all the files to jpg and also copy it.
9. I created the README file.
9. Then i pushed the files to github.
